# Red_Alert_Geolocation
This is part of the RED ALERT project to show the isreli cities affected by the rocket attacks from Islamic Jihad on August 2022

I gathered the data from Pikud Haoref, the institution responsible for the siren alerts to all regions in the country. 

After working on the data, I added the geolocation for each Red Alert and created a dashboard where you can see an hourly map of the rocket attacks toward Israel.

To add the latitude and longitude I develop a python notebook to automate the generation of geolocation for each region.

The final Tableau Dashboard is in https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/g.8610/viz/REDALERT/REDALERT
